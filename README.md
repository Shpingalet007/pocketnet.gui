# What is Bastyon?

[Bastyon](https://pocketnet.app/about) is a decentralized social network that is powered by Pocketcoin (**PKOIN**). It utilizes blockchain technology to mint blocks with rewards and transaction fees. Node operators stake Pocketcoin to generate new blocks, and half of the rewards from each block are distributed to content creators based on user ratings of their content. By eliminating a central authority or corporation, Bastyon ensures that all revenue generated from the nodes is split evenly between node operators and content creators. [Read more in Pocketnet Whitepaper](https://bastyon.com/docs/Pocketnet%20Whitepaper%20Draft%20v2.pdf).

# How to Use Bastyon?

Users of the social network can connect in three ways: 
- via the [official website](https://bastyon.com/)
- through the [desktop application](https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.gui/releases/latest)
- with the mobile app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/bastyon/id1537944200) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pocketnet.app))

## Creating an Account on Bastyon

To create an account on Bastyon, simply click "Sign in" and follow the instructions. You don't need to provide any personal information such as your email address or phone number. If you do provide your email address, it will only be used for newsletters and official Bastyon communication. Your email address and phone number will not be linked to your account.

## Private Key

When you create an account on Bastyon, a **Private Key** is generated for you. It is important to keep this key secure and confidential, as it is the only way to access your account. There is no username and password authentication – just the **Private Key**.

### Important Notes about the Private Key

Your Private Key is unique and must be kept **confidential**. 
- Make sure to **write it down** or store it in a secure location, as it **cannot be retrieved** if lost.
- If you **lose your Private Key**, there is NO WAY to restore access to your account. You can create a new account, but you will never be able to access the original one.
- The Private Key **cannot be changed**. 
- Even Bastyon's developers and administrators **cannot access, change, or reset** your Private Key.

# How Bastyon is Different from other Social Networks

Bastyon is an Open Source project that runs on distributed nodes, offering users a unique and different experience compared to major social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. It does not require any personal information such as email address or phone number, and does not track user behaviour online. Furthermore, it provides an encrypted end-to-end chat system that is not associated with any email address or phone number, unlike popular messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp.

Bastyon is also based on blockchain technology, making all operations (posts, videos, comments, likes, etc.) immutable and unalterable. Additionally, it provides users with freedom of speech without any limitations or bans due to political or religious beliefs. Lastly, the control is held by the users themselves. High-reputation users who gain "reputation points" through likes and comments on their posts are automatically ranked as administrators. If several admins report the same post, it is hidden – similar to what happens on Wikipedia, where a board of admins is elected by all users to make decisions.
